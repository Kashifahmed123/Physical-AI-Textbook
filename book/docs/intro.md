# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: An AI-Native Technical Textbook

## Welcome to the Future of Robotics Education

This comprehensive textbook presents an integrated approach to Physical AI and humanoid robotics, combining theoretical foundations with practical implementation. The content is designed for university students, software engineers, and AI practitioners seeking to understand and implement embodied intelligent systems.

### Course Structure

The textbook is organized into 8 comprehensive modules that build upon each other to provide a complete understanding of humanoid robotics:

1. **[Module 1: Physical AI Foundations](./module-1-foundations/intro.md)** - Core concepts of embodied intelligence
2. **[Module 2: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System](./module-2-ros/intro.md)** - Robot Operating System fundamentals
3. **[Module 3: Digital Twins with Gazebo & Unity](./module-3-simulations/intro.md)** - Simulation-first development
4. **[Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac & AI Robot Brains](./module-4-nvidia-isaac/intro.md)** - AI-powered robotics platforms
5. **[Module 5: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)](./module-5-vla/intro.md)** - Multimodal robot systems
6. **[Module 6: Humanoid Locomotion & Manipulation](./module-6-locomotion/intro.md)** - Movement and interaction
7. **[Module 7: Conversational Robotics](./module-7-conversational/intro.md)** - Natural human-robot interaction
8. **[Module 8: Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid Agent](./module-8-capstone/intro.md)** - Complete system integration

### Learning Approach

This textbook employs an AI-native approach with:
- Embedded RAG chatbot for interactive learning
- Simulation-first methodology for safe experimentation
- Real-world applications and practical examples
- Comprehensive review questions and exercises
- Integration with modern robotics platforms

### Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish foundational concepts, then progress through each module sequentially to build comprehensive understanding. Each module includes learning objectives, conceptual explanations, practical examples, and review questions to reinforce your understanding.

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills (Python preferred)
- Fundamental understanding of AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic linear algebra and calculus knowledge

### Technical Requirements

- ROS 2 (Humble Hawksbill or later)
- Simulation environments (Gazebo, Unity, or NVIDIA Isaac Sim)
- Python 3.8+ with robotics libraries
- Compatible hardware for physical robot experiments
