# AI-Native Software Development Research Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy through Primary Source Verification
All factual claims must be verified against credible, peer-reviewed sources before inclusion in the research; Primary sources take precedence over secondary interpretations; Claims without verifiable sources are excluded from the final work

### Academic Clarity and Precision
All technical concepts must be clearly defined before use; Writing must be accessible to readers with formal computer science training; Complex concepts should be explained with precision and without unnecessary jargon

### Reproducibility and Traceability
Every factual claim must be traceable to its original source through proper citations; Research methods and data analysis must be documented sufficiently for replication; All sources and references must be properly catalogued and verifiable

### Academic Rigor and Peer Review Standards
Minimum 50% of sources must be peer-reviewed literature (journals, conference papers); All technical claims must be supported by credible evidence; Research must meet academic standards suitable for peer review

### Original Synthesis and Zero Plagiarism
All content must be original synthesis by the author; Direct copying from sources is strictly prohibited; Proper attribution and APA citation style must be followed for all references

### Evidence-Driven Analysis
All conclusions must be supported by evidence from credible sources; Claims must be logically connected to supporting evidence; Speculation or unsupported assertions are not permitted

## Citation and Source Requirements
Minimum total sources: 15; APA citation style required for all references; Peer-reviewed sources must constitute at least 50% of total sources; All factual or technical claims must have citations; No uncited assertions allowed

## Academic Writing Standards
Writing level: Flesch-Kincaid Grade 10-12; Clear sectioning with logical progression; Properly formatted reference section required; Content must be structured for final PDF export; Terminology must be consistent throughout the chapter

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the AI-native software development research project.

All research claims must pass academic fact-checking review; Content must withstand peer review in computer science or software engineering venue; Every claim must be verified against credible sources; Source balance must meet peer-reviewed requirement; No logical leaps or unsupported conclusions permitted
