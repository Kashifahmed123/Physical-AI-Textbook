## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 7: "Conversational Robotics" for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Here's what was accomplished:

## Content Created

Created complete Module 7 content in `book/docs/module-7-conversational/intro.md` with:
- Learning objectives covering conversational AI, NLU, multi-modal interaction, and safety
- Conversational AI in physical robots with key challenges and components
- Speech recognition and NLU concepts including ASR and semantic parsing
- Multi-modal interaction combining speech, vision, and gesture
- GPT-style models integration in robotic dialogue systems
- Conversational loops and dialogue management with turn-taking mechanisms
- Safety and grounding considerations for conversational robotics
- Integration with ROS 2 and robot control systems
- Strong linkage to VLA module concepts from Module 5
- Review questions with comprehensive coverage
