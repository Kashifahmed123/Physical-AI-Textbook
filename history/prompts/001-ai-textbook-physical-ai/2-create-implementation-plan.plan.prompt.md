# Architecture Sketch

## Content Layer
The content layer consists of modular Markdown chapters organized by curriculum modules. Each chapter follows a consistent internal structure with learning objectives, conceptual explanations, system architecture diagrams, practical simulation examples, chapter summaries, and review questions. The content is processed by Docusaurus for web delivery, with support for version control via Git.

## AI-Native Layer
The AI-native layer includes three main components:
1. RAG chatbot: Processes user questions against textbook content using vector embeddings in Qdrant Cloud
2. Personalization engine: Adapts content based on learner background captured at signup
3. Translation service: Provides one-click Urdu translation per chapter

## Agent Roles
- Authoring agents: Create and validate content following academic rigor standards
- Reviewing agents: Verify citations, check for plagiarism, validate terminology consistency
- Validation agents: Ensure content meets readability requirements and learning objectives

## Data Flow
Textbook content flows from Markdown source files → Docusaurus processing → web delivery. For the RAG chatbot, content is also processed into vector embeddings stored in Qdrant Cloud. When users ask questions, the chatbot retrieves relevant content from the vector store and generates responses based strictly on book content. Personalization data is stored in Neon Postgres and used to adapt content presentation.

- Peer-reviewed journals in robotics, AI, and computer science
- Conference proceedings from top-tier venues (ICRA, IROS, RSS, CoRL)
- Authoritative textbooks and technical documentation
- Industry reports and whitepapers from reputable organizations

## Citation Decisions
Citation decisions follow these principles:
- Prioritize peer-reviewed literature to maintain the required 50%+ ratio
- Use primary sources when available rather than secondary interpretations
- Include seminal works that established foundational concepts
- Cite recent research that represents current state-of-the-art
- Verify all sources meet academic rigor standards before inclusion

## Evidence Mapping
Evidence is mapped to claims through:
- Direct citation links between specific claims and supporting sources
- Cross-referencing of related concepts across chapters
- Validation that each claim has at least one credible source
- Documentation of the relationship between evidence and claims

## Maintaining Peer-Reviewed Ratio
The minimum 50% peer-reviewed source ratio is maintained by:
- Tracking source types during the writing process
- Regularly reviewing the source composition
- Prioritizing peer-reviewed sources when multiple options exist
- Clearly marking non-peer-reviewed sources for transparency
