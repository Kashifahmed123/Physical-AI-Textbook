## Prompt

Implement Module 8: Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid Agent.

Follow constitution, specification, plan, and tasks strictly.
This module synthesizes all previous modules.

Produce a complete Markdown chapter including:
- Learning objectives
- End-to-end system architecture
- Voice command → planning → navigation → perception → manipulation
- Integration of ROS 2, simulation, Isaac, and LLMs
- Step-by-step conceptual execution flow
- Capstone evaluation criteria
- Review questions with answers
- APA citations

Integrate into Docusaurus.
Validate:
- System-level coherence
- No missing dependency explanations
- Clear synthesis of entire book

## Response snapshot

Successfully implemented Module 8: "Capstone – Autonomous Humanoid Agent" for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. Here's what was accomplished:

## Content Created

Created complete Module 8 content in `book/docs/module-8-capstone/intro.md` with:
- Learning objectives covering complete autonomous humanoid system design
- End-to-end system architecture connecting all subsystems
- Voice command → planning → navigation → perception → manipulation flow
- Integration of ROS 2, simulation, Isaac, and LLMs in unified system
- Step-by-step conceptual execution flow for complete command processing
- Capstone evaluation criteria for assessing autonomous agent performance
- Synthesis of all previous modules into comprehensive implementation
- Review questions with comprehensive coverage
- Full APA-formatted references to peer-reviewed and authoritative sources

## Integration

- Module 8 content integrated into Docusaurus sidebar navigation (autogenerated sidebar includes the new module)
- Created proper directory structure: `book/docs/module-8-capstone/`
- Content follows the same academic rigor and structure as previous modules

## Tasks Updated

Updated the tasks file to mark completed tasks:
- T104: Create Module 8 directory structure - [X]
